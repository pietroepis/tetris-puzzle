# tetris-puzzle
Image Processing Project - UniMiB

The goal of the project is to detect and classify tetris pieces (tetromini) from the scene and process them properly according to the scheme to compose the puzzle.

Input is made up by two images:
| Scheme | Scene |
|<img src="https://github.com/pietroepis/tetris-puzzle/blob/main/schemes/S06.jpg" width="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/pietroepis/tetris-puzzle/blob/main/schemes/S06.jpg" width="300"/>|
